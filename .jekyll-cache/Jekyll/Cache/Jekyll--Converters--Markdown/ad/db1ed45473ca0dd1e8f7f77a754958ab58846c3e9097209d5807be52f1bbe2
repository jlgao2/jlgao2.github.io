I"<p>So the inspiration for this website was <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/">Patrick Collison’s Website</a>, and on it he has an awesome reading list that meshes really well with my interests. He’s gone ahead and republished the book that I’m writing about today called <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119">The Dream Machine</a>. I found it really interesting and I think this review that was from my goodreads review of it will be a great way of kicking things off on this blog.</p>
