title: About
---
I live in Melbourne and study mechatronics engineering and econometrics at Monash University. I am interested in a lot of things in and around the fields of technology, society, economy and personal development. I made this website to learn a bit about practical coding and to find my public voice.
<br>
I’m looking to start my career at a place where everyone believes in what they’re working on earnestly. Let me know if you think that’s your company, or if you just want to be penpals, that would be dope.
